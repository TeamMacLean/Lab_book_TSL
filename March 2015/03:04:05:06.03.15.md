Working on BCF2 in cluster. 

```
bsub -q TSL-Test128 -o sam.txt "bwa mem TAIR10_chr_all.fas BC.fg.reads1.fq BC.fg.reads2.fq > BCF2.sam"
bsub -q TSL-Test128 -o bcf2.txt "view -bS -h BCF2.sam > BCF2.bam"
bsub -q TSL-Test128 -o bcf2.txt "samtools mpileup -B -f TAIR10_chr_all.fas BCF2.bam > BCF2.pileup"
```

When counting lines in BAM file (```view BCF2.bam | wc -l```), got this error:

```
[W::sam_read1] parse error at line 1
[main_samview] truncated file.
0

```

SAM file is wrong. 

Repeat BWA alignment using default parameters. 

- Rstudio to plot kernel densities for hm SNPs per chromosome from[Scheneeberger](http://1001genomes.org/software/shoremap.html) reads.

```
density <- ggplot(hm) + geom_density(aes(V1), colour ="blue") + xlim(0,30000000) + xlab("Genome length") + ylab("SNP density") + theme_bw()
```

For ```xlim```, I use the chromosomes sizes from [here](https://www.arabidopsis.org/portals/genAnnotation/gene_structural_annotation/agicomplete.jsp)

New model genome from chr1
---
- Fragment chromosome 1 from Arabidopsis as usually. Create 10,000-20,000 contigs. 
- Instead of using a normal distribution for hm SNPs and a uniform distribution to define the ht SNPs, I use the files hm.txt and ht.txt obtained from the VCF file from real data. 

Write [results with real SNP densities](https://github.com/pilarcormo/SNP_distribution_method/blob/master/Results/Results_0303.md)

- R online course. 1st class

pileup file from BCF2 is fine, download VarScan and obtain VCF as output:

```
bsub -q TSL-Test128 -o BCF2.txt "java -jar VarScan.v2.3.7.jar mpileup2snp BCF2.pileup --output-vcf 1"  
```

**14222 variant positions reported (14222 SNP, 0 indel)**

New model genome from chr1

After running in the cluster, the VCF file obtained is wrong (AF=WRONG in all the SNPs reported). The problem was that I was using the method file_to_array instead of file_to_ints_array from Write_it so the positions were not determined properly. Fixed it and running the model_genome script again in the cluster
