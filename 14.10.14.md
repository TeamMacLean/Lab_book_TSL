Testing GATOC using a small model genome increasing the number of generations
-------

1. Using the small model genomes created yesterday (13/10/14): [dataset_small2kb](https://github.com/pilarcormo/fragmented_genome_with_snps/tree/master/arabidopsis_datasets/Pilar/dataset_small2kb) and [dataset_small8kb](https://github.com/pilarcormo/fragmented_genome_with_snps/tree/master/arabidopsis_datasets/Pilar/dataset_small8kb), I run the [algorithm_test.rb](https://github.com/pilarcormo/fragmented_genome_with_snps/blob/master/algorithm_test.rb) again but increasing the number of generations to improve the accuracy of the results. 

<table>

  <tr><th>Fitness method</th><th>Number of generations</th><th>Population size</th><th>Select number</th><th>Chunk mutants</th><th>Swap mutants</th><th>Save</th><th>Random</th><th>Divisions (1000s)</th></tr>
  
  
  <tr> <td>snp_distance</td> <td>150</td> <td>100</td> <td>50</td> <td>35</td> <td>35</td> <td>25</td> <td>5</td> <td>1</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>max_density</td>  <td>150</td> <td>100</td> <td>50</td> <td>35</td> <td>35</td> <td>25</td> <td>5</td> <td>1</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>max_ratio</td>  <td>150</td> <td>100</td> <td>50</td> <td>35</td> <td>35</td> <td>25</td> <td>5</td> <td>1</td> </tr>
  
</table>

For each generation, 2 files are created: gen(number) and gen(number)_lists. In the first one, we find the different permutations generated and the fitness score assigned to each permutation at the top of the text file. An additional text file called best_permutation.txt shows the permutation with the best fitness score. The second file shows two text files with the positions of the SNPs (one for the homozygous and one for the heterozygous SNPs).

The fitness methods count_ratio and max_hyp give an error message when used. The method hyp_distance gives a fitness score = 0.0 in each generation. Find out why and try to use them.
