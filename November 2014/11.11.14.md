===========

Work on the [code](https://github.com/pilarcormo/small_genomes_SNPs/blob/master/Make_perm_shorter.rb) that takes the last permutation of the run and gradually removes the first and last contig to compare the remaining order with the correctly ordered genome to see if the distance measurements improves when comparing the contigs that are in the middle of the permutation. 

Having problems when trying to use the method (distance) from the gem PDist in a loop (it works outside though). Only the method lcs works properly.  I'll try to fix it.
