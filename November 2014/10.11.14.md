###SNP distance method

Run Distances_Pilar.rb on dataset_small2kb/snp_distance_150gen

The results are similar to those observed previously with the large genome. Even thought the SNP position really approaches to the real one when using this fitness method, the distance between the permutations is always constant. 

###Count ratio with large genome

Using try/count_ratio_150gen

Location of causal mutation in correctly ordered genome: 9970251

Candidate SNP position in permutation: 17751076


THINGS TO TRY
---------

- Small-big genome. Try to create bigger genomes than 2kb but smaller than the model genome I've been using to analyse the performance of the algorithm 

- Remove fragments at the ends of the permutations once we approach 

- Ruby testing
