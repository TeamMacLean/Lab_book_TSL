- Fix GATOC.rb 
- Run the algorithm with the 20 kb genome using count ratio. 5 genome divisions (countratio2) and 10 divisions (countratio3). 
- Create 100 kb genome and run count ratio with it. 5 genome divisions (countratio) and 10 divisions (countratio2).
- Test unit for measure.rb
- Add distance method as argument and add all the distance methods to measure.rb
- Use measure.rb with the 20 kb genome using deviation, square and LCS distance metrics only.
