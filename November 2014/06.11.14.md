===========

1. Use the count ratio method properly, try to find a causative SNP with it and compare results with Ed's

<table>

  <tr><th>Fitness method</th><th>Number of generations</th><th>Population size</th><th>Select number</th><th>Chunk mutants</th><th>Swap mutants</th><th>Save</th><th>Random</th><th>Divisions (1000s)</th></tr>
  
  <tr> <td>count_ratio</td> <td>150</td> <td>10</td> <td>5</td> <td>7</td> <td>7</td> <td>5</td> <td>1</td> <td>10</td> </tr>
  
</table>
 

2. Change the algorithm script  and distribution plots to avoid the need for gen files. 
2. Try to obtain the distance plots with the small genome to see if the size of the dataset is the problem. 
3. Find out what Kernell density is

Finding the causative SNP mutation with my small genomes
---
Run find_causal_mutation.rb with small genomes I created last month. 
 
•__2 Kb genome using max density method__:

Location of causal mutation in correctly ordered genome: 997
Candidate SNP position in permutation: 869

•__2 Kb genome using snp distance method__:
Location of causal mutation in correctly ordered genome: 997
Candidate SNP position in permutation: 855

•__2 Kb genome using max ratio method__:

•__8 Kb genome using max density method__:

•__8 Kb genome using snp distance method__:

•__8 Kb genome using max ratio method__:
