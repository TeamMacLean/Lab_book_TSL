Distances
---

Work on the [code](https://github.com/pilarcormo/small_genomes_SNPs/blob/master/Make_them_shorter.rb) that takes the last permutation of the run and gradually removes the first and last contig to compare the remaining order with the correctly ordered genome to see if the distance measurements improves when comparing the contigs that are in the middle of the permutation. 

Discovered the problem (see [11.11.14](https://github.com/pilarcormo/Lab_book_TSL/blob/master/November%202014/11.11.14.md)). When we remove the terminal items of the permutation, they may still be present in the original permutation. So, when it tries to look for the missing item in the permutation, we have the error. 

#####Example:

*Original (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)*

*Permutation (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1)*

Remove first and last items:

*Original (<s>1</s>, 2, 3, 4, 5, <s>6</s>)*

*Permutation (<s>2</s>, 3, 4, 5, 6, <s>1</s>)*

The gem does: for number in position 1 in original array (2), where is the item in the permutated array? IT IS NOT PRESENT! Therefore, the program adds the value 'nil' to our array of distances, and there is nothing we can do with it. To fix it, I have changed the code:

From:

```
Indices << original.map{|x| permutation.index(x)} # indices of original values in permutation
```

To:

	original.each do |i|
		if permutation.include?(i) then
			indices_original << permutation.index(i) # indices of original values in permutation
		else 
			indices_original << original.length
		end
	end

Now, if the item we are looking for is present in the permutation, we proceed normally, but if it is not, we add a different value (**I've chosen the length of the orignal array as the value to add just to try how it works, but not sure if this is the correct approach I should take**).

By now, I'm just focusing on the deviation distance method.
