===========

Firs, I try to make the count_ratio method work. I'm running the script to identify the slow parts to potentially change them to make it faster. 

When using 1 division only, the algorithm fails (fitness score assigned as NaN) but  when I increase it to 2, it works just fine. 

Now, I'm going to figure out how to improve it. 

1. Create CSV file for generations and best fitness scores. Change GATOC.rb from line 214.
```

			CSV.open("/Users/morenop/small_genomes_SNPs/arabidopsis_datasets/table.csv", "ab") do |csv|
				q = pop_fits [-1][0]
				p = gen
				csv << [p, q]
			end
			

2. Avoid creation of gen1, gen2, etc files every generation and all the permutation.txt files. I think this may be a reason for the long times needed to run the script. In GATOC.rb, line 115, I eliminate save_perms.
