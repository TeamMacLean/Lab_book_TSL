===========

First, I try to make the count_ratio method work. I'm running the script to identify the slow parts to potentially change them to make it faster. 

When using 1 division only, the algorithm fails (fitness score assigned as NaN) but  when I increase it to 2, it works just fine. 

Now, I'm going to figure out how to improve it. 

1. Create CSV file for generations and best fitness scores. Change GATOC.rb from line 219.


			path = "arabidopsis_datasets/#{opts[:dataset]}/#{opts[:run]}/table.csv"
			CSV.open(path, "wb") do |csv|
				csv << ["Generation", "Best fitness score"]
			end
			puts 'here it comes'
			puts path
			CSV.open(path, "ab") do |csv|
				q = pop_fits [-1][0]
				p = gen
				csv << [p, q]
			end
			

2. Avoid creation of gen1, gen2, etc files every generation and all the permutation.txt files. I think this may be a reason for the long times needed to run the script. In GATOC.rb, line 115, I eliminate save_perms.  



Plans for the week
-------
1. Use the count ratio method properly, try to find a causative SNP with it and compare results with Ed's
2. Change the algorithm script  and distribution plots to avoid the need for gen files. 
2. Try to obtain the distance plots with the small genome to see if the size of the dataset is the problem. 
3. Find out what Kernell density is
