Objectives
-------

- The distance metrics aren't good at discriminating the small changes in the large data sets we are looking at. So we need to be looking for a better, more discriminating way. It is interesting that the SNP containing fragment goes to the middle quite quickly. Does this mean after X permutations, we can discard fragments?

- Max density method: decrease size of the populations to check if we can reach a plateu when plotting scores vs generations. 




Running the algorithm with count ratio method
-------
p6 from [count ratio results](https://github.com/pilarcormo/fragmented_genome_with_snps/blob/master/Progress/Results1_count_ratio/results.Rmd):

<table>

  <tr><th>Fitness method</th><th>Number of generations</th><th>Population size</th><th>Select number</th><th>Chunk mutants</th><th>Swap mutants</th><th>Save</th><th>Random</th><th>Divisions (1000s)</th></tr>
  
  
  <tr> <td>count_ratio</td> <td>150</td> <td>20</td> <td>10</td> <td>7</td> <td>7</td> <td>5</td> <td>1</td> <td>10</td> </tr>
   <tr> <td>count_ratio</td> <td>5</td> <td20</td> <td>10</td> <td>7</td> <td>7</td> <td>5</td> <td>1</td> <td>10</td> </tr>

</table>

Using dataset called "try" and subdirectory called "count_ratio150gen" and "count_ratio3"

REALLY REALLY SLOW (2 h/generaton). If I change the script to run a little bit faster, I want to try
