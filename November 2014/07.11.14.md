===========

1. Use the count ratio method properly, try to find a causative SNP with it and compare results with Ed's


I'm using the count ratio method with both the small 2 kb genome and the large genome I called "try"
 

Finding the causative SNP mutation with my small genomes v 2.0
---
Run find_causal_mutation.rb with small genomes I created last month. 
 
â€¢__2 Kb genome using count ratio method__: 

Position in the correct ordered genome: 997
