- Conclusion: distance metrics are not discriminating!

- Fitness score in count ratio method:

	For each genome division, it defines the hm and ht SNPs and calculate a ratio hm/ht. 
	
	Then, it compares all the ratios obtained with the expected ratios by using the absolute Pearson's correlation coefficient that is _"a measure of the linear correlation (dependence) between two variables X_ (expected ratios) _and Y_ (permutation ratios), _giving a value between +1 and −1 inclusive, where 1 is total positive correlation, 0 is no correlation, and −1 is total negative correlation"._ In this case, as it is the aboslute correlation, we only have values oscillating between 1 and 0 (correlation or not).
	
	
	
	- 3D plot (density plot) that calculates the value of r in the Pearson correlation for a given genome lenght and a number of divisions. 
	
Genome size: 1 Mb-20 Mb
Divisions: 500-10,000

- Don't know which ratios I should  use to calculate the correlation. If I just shuffle the array of fragments, it generates a randome order and every time the value of r is different.
