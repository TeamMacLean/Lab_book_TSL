Plot the fitness score and the distance vs the number of generations
-------

Using the output files generated after running the algorithm, I generate a csv file with the number of generations and the best fitness score for each generation. For that, I run [CSVtable.rb](https://github.com/pilarcormo/small_genomes_SNPs/blob/master/CSVtable.rb)

In [this example](https://github.com/pilarcormo/small_genomes_SNPs/blob/master/table.csv) I have used the 2 kb genome, the max_density method and only 10 generations to try the script. 

The ultimate idea is to change the original script to avoid the generation of so many gen and gen_list files to lower the running time. 

After that, RinRuby can be used to plot the graph.
