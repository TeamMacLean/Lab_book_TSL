New 8 kb genome
-------
I realized I didn't change the script [small_test_genome.rb](https://github.com/pilarcormo/fragmented_genome_with_snps/blob/master/small_test_genome.rb) from 2000 to 8000 pb in the following line (ht_r) and I think it may alter the model genome generated. Therefore, I ran it again to see what happens. 

```
ruby 
hm_r = 'hm <- rnorm(50, 1000, 100)' 
ht_r = 'ht <- runif(50, 1, 8000)'  
hm, ht = ModelGenome::get_snps(hm_r, ht_r)
snp_pos = [hm, ht].flatten
```


New parameters for the algorithm
-------

Looking at the the distribution plots generated [yesterday](https://github.com/pilarcormo/small_genomes_SNPs/blob/master/Results.md), I think I have to readjust the parameters used to run the script because the distribution plots change to much for each new generation. I decreased all the parameters except for the number of generations. I used the 2 kb genome as input.
