Getting things to work
-------
1. Using Github in the command line: [Git Book](http://git-scm.com/book/)
2. In order to generate the .gif files that compile all the distribution plots genterated in the previous days, I download Imagemagick:
```brew install ImageMagick``` 


Obtaining the results
-------
- To facilitate the results interpretation, once I got all the distribution plots (one for each generation) as it can be seen in (link), I used the script [**magick.sh**](https://github.com/pilarcormo/fragmented_genome_with_snps/blob/master/magick.sh) (it needs to be in the file where the generation files were created):
```sh magick.sh```

- This program puts together all the distribution plots and creates a .gif image that shows the SNP density for each generation. I ran the program for the 3 fitness methods used and for the 2 genome sizes, generating 6 .gif images.
