- Incorporate the useful methods from reform_ratio into Stuff and remove reiterations in code. In particular, don't need the perm_hm and perm_ht text files, so stop creating them in script. Change unit tests accordingly. 
- Finish 3.2 and 3.3 (results)
- Update figure 3 showing ratio used as threshold (10% was missing)

####Next
- Create new model genomes with a contig size following the gam model developed for illumina HiSeq N50 sizes.
