- Work on missing 5-7 Mb genomes from model genomes to calculate the deviation. Reproduce SDM for all the small genomes 
- Contig size analysis 
	- Linear regresion of log(N50) vs log(Genome size) with confidence intervals 
	- Probability N50 vs genome length. Figure it out. 
- Write SDM results for NGS reads, and  README files for all the folders in Git. Remake qqplots
