- Research integrity workshop
- Check all the original reads are available at the data folder in the hpc. BCF2 and its parental line are not in here so I'm depositing them back.

- Poster. Done. Send for printing on Monday
- Methods. Add links, divdide in more sections
- Improve preprint pandoc output (change colours, etc) 
- Arrange data folders for cluster projects. Now they look like this:

**tsl/data/reads/plants/arabidopsis/{study}/reads**
**tsl/data/reads/plants/arabidopsis/{study}/Alignment**

where study can be **bcf2_Allen2013**, **Aw_sup_Uchida2011**, **ocf2_Galvao2012**, **ngm_austin_etal2011** (this one is not finished). 

Reads and trimmed reads are provided for mutants and parental lines. In the alignment folders, BAM files and VCF files should be always available. In some cases, also SAM and pileup files are found. 

For the mob_mutants, mutant reads can be found at
**tsl/data/reads/plants/arabidopsis/mobmutants** while parental reads are at **tsl/data/reads/plants/arabidopsis/bak1_5**. The alignment folder is in **usr/users/sl/morenop/mob_mutants**
