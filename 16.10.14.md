Distribution plots generation
-------

I use the [distribution_plots.rb](https://github.com/pilarcormo/fragmented_genome_with_snps/blob/master/distribution_plots.rb) to generate, for each fitness method used, distribution plots for each generation. One represents the heterozygous SNP density, other the homozygous SNP density and the last one shows the approzimated ratio of homozygous to heterozygous SNP density. 

I run the stript for the 3 different fitness methods I used and for both model genomes (2 and 8 kb). For each generation, the 3 distribution plots are obtained. 

The distribution_plot script uses the **best permutation** (highest fitness score) for each generation and represents the **SNP density for each genomic position** (black line) in comparison to the real distribution (blue line) to check the effectiveness of the fitness method. 

Next
-------

1. Try to generate data for the 3 fitness methods that were not working correctly
2. Compare the plots generated for the different fitness methods and the different genome lenghts. 
3. Create .gift from the plots generated
