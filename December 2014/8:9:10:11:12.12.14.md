Finish CC plots and polish [results](https://github.com/pilarcormo/Correlations/blob/master/Results/Results.md). 

Now: run the algorithm with the parameters that seem to work fine as seen in the correlation experiment. First, assign SNPs distributions.

=====
Create model genome using the [chromosome 1 from A. thaliana](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/CP002684&display=fasta) of lenght 30427671 bp


There are 9988 homozygous SNPs
There are 9995 heterozygous SNPs

1690 contigs are created (ideally, this number should be higher, because we are generating contigs that are too large.)


Prepare sh to run algorithm in cluster.
