Finish CC plots and polish [results](https://github.com/pilarcormo/Correlations/blob/master/Results/Results.md). 

Now: run the algorithm with the parameters that seem to work fine as seen in the correlation experiment. First, assign SNPs distributions.

Create model genome using the [chromosome 1 from A. thaliana](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/CP002684&display=fasta) of lenght 30427671 bp


There are 9988 homozygous SNPs

There are 9995 heterozygous SNPs

1690 contigs are created (ideally, this number should be higher, because we are generating contigs that are too large.)


Prepare sh to run algorithm in cluster.

Run yesterday in the cluster failed (run"i") because the R package 'pracma' needed in the GATOC script was not installed. I was using the NBI cluster, so I change to the TSL cluster and try running them again (run"i"_letter) as it seems the 'pracma' library is installed there.

Algorithm is still running. It creates 1,875 generations/h so I hope it is done tomorrow. 

Read a few papers:

Algorithm is still running.

I got first results for the 10 divisions run1_A. It stops at 79 generation and the SNP prediction is pretty accurate: 

- Location of causal mutation in correctly ordered genome: 15187413

- Candidate SNP position in permutation: 12865196

However, the distribution plots are not very good as they don't approach to the ideal distribution when increasing the number of generations. 

Discuss with Carlos the algorithm.
