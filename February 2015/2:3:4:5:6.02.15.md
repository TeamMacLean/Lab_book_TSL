- Plotting in R studio 
- Undestand how the ratios are calculated

- Recalculating ratios. Instead of calculating the ratios per divisions, I am trying to calculate the ratios per each fragment. 
- Remove ratios that are lower than a given value (I am currently using 1). Then, I am trying to redefine the peak finding by only using these ratios (obviously, instead of using the whole genome, I have to define the search to the part of the genome where these ratios are calculated).
