Create new repository for SDM in order to focus on the method and run the proper test, etc.

Try to use Magnum CI with new the repository. Have to figure out how to use it properly. Error:

			 Could not locate Gemfile
			 
Write Gemfile and Gemfile.lock. Rerun build. After that, same problem with Rakefile for the unit tests. 

New problem: test fails when initialising rinruby 
			
			`popen': No such file or directory - R (Errno::ENOENT)
