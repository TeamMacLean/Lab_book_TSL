The algorithm ran for a few generations and then it apparently stopped. There is no output message. I am trying to restart it again today. 

Work on the previous run (run1_A). 

New ordering method
---

After running my new ordering method and then the algorithm for just 1 generation I obtain this causal SNP location prediction: 

- Location of causal mutation in correctly ordered genome: 997
- Candidate SNP position in permutation: 1145


This was expected, as the contigs in the middle of the permutation that are the ones used to define the SNP position are more or less correctly located thanks to the new method. The problem is in the remaining contigs that are located towards the ends of the permutation. I try with a larger genome to see if this is reproducible. When using a 20 kb genome and 4 generations I got: 

- **Location of causal mutation in correctly ordered genome: 10028**

- **Candidate SNP position in permutation: 9864**


When I previously used the count_ratio method a few months ago I got:

- **Location of causal mutation in correctly ordered genome: 10028**
- **Candidate SNP position in permutation: 15026**

Cannot effectively used the algorithm with the new fasta array as the initial population because the initial population is an array of arrays and each subarray is created by permutating randomly (shuffle) the correctly ordered array. I'm using as start the new array instead of the correctly ordered but this is not accurate.
