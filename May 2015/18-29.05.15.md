- Give several output options after SDM - Use ratios for SDM sorting step  as they are expected to follow a normal disitrbution. Then, I have candidate contigs that high hm SNP density (SDM_hm) and other that have a high hm/ht ratio (SDM_ratio). If they overlap, I can say with certainty that the mutation is in those contigs. 
- Write unit tests

- Council week
- Starting writing [preprint](https://github.com/pilarcormo/Preprint). Prepare outline, abstract, title, start writing results. 
- Prepare figures and pipelines

26-27/05/15

- Write results for preprint. Divide 4 sections in 7 because they were very long. Aim for 200-300 words per section. 
- Plan the figures that go into the results and the additional ones. 

######Next

Possible table for results - fragments identified by SDM and real mutations positions. 
Finish section number 7 and read everything.
